# Energy Statistics

## The Data:
The data set that will be used in this project is called 'US Energy Statistics' and can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/us-energy-statistics?select=TOTAL.json) It consists of nine JSON files:<br>
 - **Coal:** Ash content for each US state per year
 - **Electric system operating data:** hourly demand for electric per state
 - **International:** annual petroleum stock per country per year
 - **Natural Gas:**
     - Weekly working underground storage by US region
     - Price and amount of monlthy re-exports to Portugal
     - Weekly and daily futures contracts
 - **Petroleum:**  Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB, Daily
 - **Petroleum Imports:** Monthly imports per US region and international export location, per refinment level
 - **State energy data system:** 
    - Net interstate flow of electricity per state
    - Biomass total consumtion per state
    - Biomass inputs per state

 - **Short term energy outlook:** Quarterly Consumption and production for crude and distilled oil in different sectors internationaly
  - **Total energy:** 
     - Monthly solar energy consumption and generation in residential, and utility-scale sectors
     - Monthly transportation sector total energy consumption and CO2 emissions
     - US department of agriculture and transportation sectors total consumptions annually
     - Primary energy stock change annually


## Questions:
 - **Which US state consumes the most biomass?**
 - **Which state produces the most?**
 - **Statistical differences in production and usege amongst regions.**
 - **What are the "greenest" states**
 - **Compair energy demand between residential, commercial, trasportation, and agruculture and the offset of solar energy**
 - **How much more solar energy needs to be generated to decrease the demand for petroleum energy by a certiain percent?**<br>

 *The list goes on and on*
